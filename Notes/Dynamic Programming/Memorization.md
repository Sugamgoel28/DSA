# How to reach the Most Optimal DP solution?
## Step-1: Recursion
- Understand the problem thoroughly.
- Derive & Implement the recursive relation.
- Write the base case.
- Recursive solution is implemented. 

## Step-2: Dynamic Programming + Memorization (Top-Down Approach)
- Initialize a dp vector, and set all the values to -1.
- Store the recursion output in the dp vector.
- Below the base case, check if dp vector != -1 then return the value.

## Dynamic Programming Tabulation (Bottom Up Approach)




## Optimization of Space (If Possible)
