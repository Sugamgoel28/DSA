<h1>BFS Traversal in Graphs</h1>
<ul>
  <li>BFS ---> Breadth-first search</li>
  <li>Similar to BFT of trees, in which all the nodes at a particular level are printed first.</li>
  <li>The only difference b/w BFS of trees and Graphs is that Graphs may contain loops.</li>
  <li>To keep a track of loops, a bool variable will be initialized (Visited or Not visited).</li>

</ul>
